        <h3>Tablets are the new laptops</h3>
        <p>
            With the advent of GitHub Codespaces, VSCode, StackBlitz, and others, its very clear where the modern development environment is moving.
            <strong><em>to the cloud!</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine a scenario where companies no longer need to supply employees with ultra-super-powerful-mega computing devices. All expensive processing is handled in a private cloud and streamed back to the accessing thin-client.
        </p>
        <p>
            What would cost a company roughly ~2k for a new Macbook Pro, can now achieved with a low-end laptop or tablet device.
            Repairing and maintaining company equipment is reduced by a large factor, and can be easily replaced without breaking the bank. This is especially valuable when it comes to small business/startups.

        <h3>Environment issues no-more</h3>
        <p>As GitHub had mentioned in their blog post about GitHub Codespaces, employees were able to avoid weird and tedious environment issues utilizing Codespaces as the interface to the GitHub source itself.</p>
        <p>Onboarding processes in-turn will be much easier, avoiding large (and often outdated) README.md files explaining how to setup local environments.</p>

        <h3>Access anywhere, from anything<sup>*that has internet access</sup></h3>
        <p>
            Forgetting your device at home or at a friend/relatives/etc place will be a thing of the past.
            Any internet capable device that has access to a (relatively) modern web browser will allow you to continue where you left off with no extra overhead.

        <h3>My plans for 2022 Onwards</h3>
        <p>
            My plan for the remainder of 2021 is to continue to refine and explore utilizing my tablet to move more of my workflow to different clouds (private, and public).
            In addition, I will create, and maintain a SaaS product solely using my tablet device (to the best of my abilities, afaik its totally doable).
