        <h3>Tablets are the new laptops/thin-clients.</h3>
        <p>
            With the advent of GitHub Codespaces, VSCode, StackBlitz, and others, its very clear where the modern development environment is moving.
            <strong><em>to the cloud!</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine a scenario where companies no longer need to supply employees with ultra-super-powerful-mega computing devices. All expensive processing is handled in a private cloud and streamed back to the accessing thin-client.
        </p>
        <p>
            What would cost a company roughly ~2k for a new Macbook Pro, can now achieved with a low-end laptop or tablet device.
            Repairing and maintaining company equipment is reduced by a large factor, and can be easily replaced without breaking the bank. This is especially valuable when it comes to small business/startups.
